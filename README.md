# odin-recipes
List of recipes (part of Odin course)
This project will be a website with a brut aspect (no CSS), here we aim to make a recipe website.
In order to achieve this, we will use all of the HTML knowledge that we learnt before.
The main page will be providing links to recipes where we can post list of ingredients, tasks and images
